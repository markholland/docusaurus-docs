# Issue Boards and BCF

An "issue board" is the same as a BCF project, and an "issue" is the same as a BCF topic.
In bimsync, you may have multiple issue boards in the same project.

**project_id** points to the issue board, while **bimsync_project_id** points to the Catenda project

Users are managed within a Catenda project.
